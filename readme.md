##WDI8 Project 2
#Dear Santa
_July 2016_

###Main Functional Idea
-The main idea is for users(children) to create a list of things they would like from Santa for Christmas! They can then share their 'wishlists' with their parents, friends and Obama, who can view the entire list and each item in more detail.

###User Model
-Dear Santa uses a private enterprise model, thus as a casual user I cannot view any users wishlists, even my own, unless I have previously created an account and am currently logged in. *Santa respects my privacy, despite his ubiquitous surveillance activities from the North Pole.* As a casual user, I can only read the short 'about me' section directly on the _homepage_.

-To create my own account, I must go to the _create account page_ and input a name and password, however I can also include; a photo, my age and location. *My password is stored in an encrypted state in Santas database, right next to all my snapchat pics.*

-Once my account is created I am then directed to the _login page_, where I login with my username and password.

-Once I'm logged I am directed to _my profile page_, which displays all my details.

-From there I can either go the the _view wishlist_ page, or the _edit wishlist_ page.

-The _edit wishlist_ page includes the detials(name, price, picture) of the items in the wishlist, with a delete button attached to each item. At the bottom of the list is a button to add a new item to the list. There is also a button to save the updated list. New wishlist items must be given a name, with options to include a price and/or a picture of the item.

-Once I have created and edited my wishlist items to my satisfaction, I can then navigate to the _view wishlist_ page to view what Santa is bringing me for Christmas. *Results may vary.*
